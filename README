Compilation 
-----------
./autogen.sh 
make

Configuration
-------------
- 2 users: <user1> <usr2> with the same password
- 3 group: <gp1> <gp2> <common>
with
gp1:user1
gp2:usr2
common:user1, usr2

- clear text UAM

- an empty volume:
drwxrwsr-x    5 user1   common         176 avr 27 23:56 test/ 

- some tests need a small read write volume, I'm using a 2 MBytes loopback

example for 
afpd.conf:
#<<<<<<
- -uamlist uams_clrtxt.so,uams_guest.so 
#<<<<<<<

AppleVolume.default
#<<<<<<<<
# volume mount read only 
# not empty at least 2 files and one folder (empty).
/mnt/cdrom cdrom dbpath:/opt/var/afpd/cdrom 

/u/test test
#<<<<<<<<

For testing with a Mac, same config (user1 or user2 are not owner)

make check
----------

You can also run the complete spectest (one user, two users, local access) with
`make check`. To do so, run:
- `make check` once in order to generate a boilerplate config file "spectest.conf"
- edit "spectest.conf" to suit your need
- run `make check` again

Return Code
-----------
0 PASSED 
1 FAILED
2 NOT TESTED the test failed too early

spectest, logintext and rotest shall return the same results whether they are run
on a Mac server or afpd.

Tests prg in test directory:
----------------------------

./spectest:
exercise AFP calls
Assume exported volumes are only modified with netatalk.

./logintest
Tests for DSI and login. Not included in spectest.

./rotest
Tests on a read only volume. Not included in spectest.

./failed_spectest
Tests which fail with current netatalk but pass on a Mac.

./T2_spectest
Tests when .AppleDouble is missing, bogus.
Need local access to volume (-c option).

./afpclient
First try for a test suite and is obsolete.

Helpers and benchmarks:
./afparg
The beginning of an AFP CLI client, cf ./afparg -l
FPResolveID <file CNID>
FPCopyFile <source> <dest>

./afp_ls
'minimal' ls using AFP commands. Should be migrated to afparg.

./postmark
Classic postmark benchmark with AFP commands.

./speedtest
bench Read, Write and file copy (either Read/Write or FPCopyFile),
it can also run the same tests using Posix syscalls and can
be use for testing afpd speed against local or others protocols.

./loadtest
run a bunch of cmds for testing server load.

Example:
--------
Run all tests on server 192.168.2.123
spectest  -h 192.168.2.123 -u user1 -d usr2 -s test -w  toto
Same but on a Mac
spectest -m -h 192.168.2.64 -u user1 -d usr2 -s test -w  toto

Run FPByteRangeLock tests with AFP 3.0, two different servers are exporting the same volume.
T2_spectest -f FPByteRangeLock -3  -h 192.168.2.123 -H 192.168.2.124 -u user1 -d usr2 -s test -c /u/test -w toto 

At least on linux, it's possible to compile them with LDFLAGS=-rdynamic
and the program can run individual test:
./T2_spectest -4 -u <user> -d <seconduser> -w <passwd> -s <vol> -c <path> -f test235

Tests output
------------

Test name
if the test is not executed, reason, ex: SKIPPED (need AFP 3.x)      
list of AFP calls executed with error code if any

if Mac result and Netatalk differ or if Mac result differ between versions, Mac result
Ex:
header.dsi_code       -5000     AFPERR_ACCESS
MAC RESULT: -5019 AFPERR_PARAM    -5010 AFPERR_BUSY
Netatalk returns AFPERR_ACCESS when a Mac return AFPERR_PARAM or AFPERR_BUSY

if Mac and Netatalk now return the same result:
Warning MAC and Netatalk now same RESULT!
